# Questions for week 10 session

In week 10 I will be answering to your questions. This is where you propose your questions. 

## Instructions

Please **propose your questions by Friday night, by opening an issue on this repository**. Be precise. If you want, you can provide a piece of code and ask about it. You can also ask about previous weeks' assignments' solutions. 

**You cannot ask about current assignments here**.

**You can upvote questions** that you think are crucial. Click to the issue, and you should see an emoji on it. Click on it, and upvote it by using the thumbs up emoji. The more thumbs up, the more important the question is, and therefore I will give priority to it when deciding which questions I should answer first.
